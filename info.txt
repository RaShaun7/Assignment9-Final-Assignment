Controls:
  WASD to move
  SPACE to jump
  T to go into first/third person
  mouse(1) to thrwo sword
  mouse(0) to get pulled to sword
  4 to fix things if player gets stuck...hopefully

What was completed:
  -Player can walk, run, jump, control freefall.
  -camera can be third or first person
  -player throws sword at camera direction
  -player can pull themself toward the sword
  -player can stand on sword
  -sword stands upright if throw at ground
  -sword returns after brief period of flight if not interacted with
  -sword acts only as a temporary platform in air but permanent in ground
  -sword can only be throw in the air twice
 
What was not completed:
  -Had planned to implement a few enemies, but the real focus was on the players ability to be very mobile yet restricted.
  The enemies were going to require some easy coding compared to the player, so I decided to rather commit to 1 "polished" game asset     rather than multple unfinished/simply coded ones.
  
  -flying dragon that circled around and shot at player current location
  -maybe a dragon that shot homing missels
  -enemies that walked around aimlessly, but upon seeing player would move toward them
  -these enemies would also follo one another if they had seen eachother, like a train, and increaase in speed slightly to a cap.
  -make the sword have hp so it would be reset if enemies hit it
  -make player able to breathe fire to solidify platforms to stand on
  -make enemy that had "magnetism" so it would pull your weapon away if thrown too close
  -basic shockwave/groundpound attack enemies
  -find nice sound/music/textures/materials
  
Any unexpected tasks that came up:
  -Well currently github not letting me commit is a REAL problem. Used the same gitignore as last time but doesnt work. Still cant          figure it out, seems adding a long list of gitattributes lowered the amount of warnings, but there are a couple still stopping me        from commiting. I've probably spent 4 hours researching this. 
  -Didn't expect to spend nearly as long as I did working on character physics it was worth it though.
